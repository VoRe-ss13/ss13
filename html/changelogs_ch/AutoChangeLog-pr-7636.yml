  - balance: "Removed the random EVA 'slipping' chance. This contributed nothing besides making spacewalks without magboots incredibly annoying."
  - balance: "The 'thunk' proc (walking onto a gravity tile from zero gravity) now only stuns you for 1 tick (around one second or less) and no longer weakens you. This'll cause you to drop what you're holding but otherwise it's only a brief, mild disruption for not using magboots or walk intenting onto a tile with gravity."

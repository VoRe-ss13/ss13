changes:
  - rscadd: "Added a missing shutter on deck one docking area"
  - rscadd: "Added airlock tanks and station to the broken airlock by the vault and connected it to distro, so this should function properly now."
  - rscadd: "Added some missing shutters from airlocks for consistency"
  - rscdel: "Deleted some unnecessary emergency shutters on airlock windows for consistency"
  - rscdel: "Deleted a random extra vent in deck 1 security checkpoint"
  - rscdel: "Deleted unused wiring and scrubber pipework that used to go to the old vault through maints. The vault now pulls from elsewhere."
  - bugfix: "Fixed the positioning of the fire alarms on the restaurant and bar outsider shelter"
  - bugfix: "Fixed the access levels on the trading ship airlock and suit cycler"
  - bugfix: "Fixed the airlock on the trading ship so that the buttons and control panel operate the doors. KNOWN BUG: Trying to cycle the airlock results in one tick of cycled air before the vents shut down. I'm unsure how to fix this but the doors can still be overridden and manually cycled. There's atmos shields on the doors either way to prevent air loss"
  - bugfix: "Rotates the pressure regulators on deck one to face the right direction, no longer cutting off half of deck 1 from distro. This loop is probably in need of improvements but it works."

  VoRe-bot:
  - bugfix: Old laser4 moved to modular_chomp to prevent conflict issues, and references
      to this sound file altered accordingly
  - bugfix: Corrected a misplaced chompedit that removed code necessary for cyborgs
      to navigate in space.

      making spacewalks without magboots incredibly annoying.

      only stuns you for 1 tick (around one second or less) and no longer weakens
      you. This'll cause you to drop what you're holding but otherwise it's only a
      brief, mild disruption for not using magboots or walk intenting onto a tile
      with gravity.

      parent type.

  VoRe-bot:
  - bugfix: Old laser4 moved to modular_chomp to prevent conflict issues, and references
      to this sound file altered accordingly
  - bugfix: Corrected a misplaced chompedit that removed code necessary for cyborgs
      to navigate in space.

      behind when the shuttle jumps (not that it gets used)

      making spacewalks without magboots incredibly annoying.

      only stuns you for 1 tick (around one second or less) and no longer weakens
      you. This'll cause you to drop what you're holding but otherwise it's only a
      brief, mild disruption for not using magboots or walk intenting onto a tile
      with gravity.

      parent type.
